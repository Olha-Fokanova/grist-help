## What's old

[![Year in review](../images/newsletters/2024-12/banner.png)](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-2024-year-in-review/){:target="\_blank"}

Check out our [annual retrospective](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-2024-year-in-review/){:target="\_blank"} to see what changed with Grist over the past twelve months, including underrated features and a community contributions collage.

## What's new

### Run Grist on Azure

![Grist on Azure](../images/newsletters/2024-12/azure.png)

Last month we mentioned that Grist is now [available on the AWS marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-tew3ygop5xxy4?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa){:target="\_blank"}. This month, we get to announce that you can also find Grist on the [Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/grist.grist-builder-edition){:target="\_blank"}. The easiest way to set up a self-hosted instance, just got... another option.

### Security update

On December 17th we released a build with several bugfixes found during a security audit. If you're using Grist at getgrist.com, rest easy ‚Äì the bugfixes have been patched. Self-hosters are recommended to update to `grist-core` version 1.3.2 as soon as possible.

Release notes: [https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.3.2](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.3.2){:target="\_blank"}

### Grist Paris Summit

*Pictured: CTO Paul, software engineer Jarek, and co-CEOs Anais & Dmitry*

On December 3rd, we were lucky enough to take part in the first [Grist Summit in Paris](https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/grist-paris-summit-2024){:target="\_blank"}, co-organized by DINUM‚Äôs Grist Gouv team, La Suite num√©rique, and ANCT. A hearty thanks to all organizers and attendees for a successful event!

Expect more from this event in the new year, but Dmitry posted a [comprehensive roundup](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7270578128572366849/){:target="\_blank"} and a [summary of shared Grist use cases](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7272962732570660864/){:target="\_blank"} on LinkedIn which are worth a look! Also, Paul and Jarek were nice enough to repeat their [well-attended talk on Grist‚Äôs custom widget builder widget](https://www.getgrist.com/webinars/custom-widget-builder/){:target="\_blank"}.

### New template - Recurring tasks ‚ôªÔ∏è

![Audit logs](../images/newsletters/2024-12/recurring-tasks.png)

We‚Äôve just released a [new template](https://www.getgrist.com/templates/recurring-tasks/){:target="\_blank"} which shows how to track TODOs that repeat, so you can mark them complete, and then reset them for another cycle. A task tracker‚Äôs work is never done! 

### SCIM in Grist

Early support for SCIM ([System for Cross-domain Identity Management](https://scim.cloud/){:target="\_blank"}) has been added to Grist, for any self-hosters who manage users across multiple services. Unfortunately, this very useful feature does not lend itself well to a neat-looking screenshot. üòî

Learn more about it in our [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/install/scim/#scim){:target="\_blank"}.

## Community highlights

It‚Äôs no coincidence that this month‚Äôs highlights are full of custom widgets. The [new custom widget builder custom widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/new-community-widget-custom-widget-builder/6803){:target="\_blank"} has had a hand in making custom widget-making handier. Say that ten times fast!

* celine_delval shared a [beautiful custom widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/tutorial-building-santas-workshop-dashboard-with-custom-widget-builder-a-step-by-step-guide-to-advanced-visualization-in-grist/7478){:target="\_blank"} (built using the aforementioned builder) just in time for Santa‚Äôs season, though I‚Äôm sure there are countless non-yule applications. üéÖ
![Santa's workshop widget](../images/newsletters/2024-12/christmas-template.gif)

* Raphael_Guinot shared (and updated) his [ambitious timeline widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/ws-timeline-timeline-widget/7424/10){:target="\_blank"}, replete with custom shortcuts, a Gantt tool, and PDF exporting (!).
![Ws-timeline widget](../images/newsletters/2024-12/ws-timeline.png)

* Edouard_Gomez-Vaez solved a frequent issue of multiparty cost splitting with his simple yet powerful [shared expenses widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/shared-expenses-template/7592){:target="\_blank"}.
![Shared expenses widget](../images/newsletters/2024-12/cost-splitter.png)

* Jordi (who works at Grist), shared a peek at his custom sunburst graph built using the builder to visualize his NES collection/shopping list.
