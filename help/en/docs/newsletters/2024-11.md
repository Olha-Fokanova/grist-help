## Grist Paris Summit full schedule posted

![Grist summit schedule](../images/newsletters/2024-11/agenda.png)

The first ever Grist Summit is **next week!** And just in time, we have the full schedule over at [La Suite‚Äôs site](https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/grist-paris-summit-2024#agenda){:target="\_blank"}. 

Unable to join us in France? The main stage events will be recorded and shared after the fact, so keep an eye out for those. Otherwise, we can‚Äôt wait to see you in Paris!

## What's new

### New on the blog: Translating Grist into 20+ languages

![Grist translation overview](../images/newsletters/2024-11/blog-translate.png)

We‚Äôre constantly impressed with the contributions of Grist‚Äôs community translators. To mark an arbitrary milestone of 20 languages in less than two years, we‚Äôve written up [a timeline of the localization process](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/how-anct-and-the-open-source-community-helped-translate-grist-into-20-languages/){:target="\_blank"}. See how volunteer contributors, ANCT and open source tools combine to let billions use Grist in their native language. 

### Grist Labs Labs: Displaying 1M+ rows with better-sqlite3

![Grist + better-sqlite3](../images/newsletters/2024-11/labsv2.png)

Dmitry shared a peek at the (very) experimental side of spreadsheet development, with [a nifty prototype](https://grist-gristlabs-megagrist-fly-preview.fly.dev/uL5WsH1M93HD/Book-Recommendations-Big/p/1){:target="\_blank"} using [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3){:target="\_blank"} that has Grist zipping around a document with >1M rows. It works just as you‚Äôd expect, assuming you don‚Äôt expect the following features to function: importing and exporting, formulas, access rules, filtering, summary tables, search, snapshots/history... 

We hope to show you more experiments as we‚Äôre able! üë©‚Äçüî¨

### Run Grist on the AWS cloud

![Grist on AWS Marketplace](../images/newsletters/2024-11/aws.png)

Grist is now available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-tew3ygop5xxy4?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa){:target="\_blank"}, giving you a simple way of self-hosting Grist (with authentication) in your own cloud. If you need to run Grist on servers in Europe, this is the easiest way to do it. We‚Äôre also looking at placing Grist on other cloud marketplaces ‚Äì if you have a favorite, let us know!

Thanks to users of the beta product for their feedback. Users can migrate from the beta (now legacy) version by following [these steps](https://support.getgrist.com/install/aws-marketplace-transition/){:target="\_blank"}.

### Grist Business - Audit Logs

![Audit logs](../images/newsletters/2024-11/audit-logs.png)

Self-hosting Grist Business plan users can now enable audit logging. Audit logs can help maintain compliance and identify misuse by helping answer questions like ‚Äúwhen was a workspace removed?‚Äù or ‚Äúwho invited a collaborator to a document?‚Äù.

Currently, audit log streaming supports HEC endpoints (like [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/){:target="\_blank"} or [Vector](https://vector.dev/){:target="\_blank"}), or other destinations via HTTP. Full documentation can be found in our [Help Center](https://support.getgrist.com/install/audit-log-overview/#audit-log-overview){:target="\_blank"}.

### Editing document types

<span class="screenshot-large">*![Document types](../images/newsletters/2024-11/document-type.png)*</span>
{: .screenshot-half }

Did you know there are distinct Grist document types? Well, now you can specifically set them in Document Settings! If you need to create templates or tutorials to be shared with other users, these types align the open behavior to those formats.

## Community highlights

* Leonard_Gallion (of [Basic HTML Reporting Template](https://community.getgrist.com/t/basic-html-reporting-template/2631){:target="\_blank"} fame) shared their setup for [external backups of Grist files in Node Red](https://community.getgrist.com/t/basic-grist-backup-in-node-red/7229){:target="\_blank"}, letting you automatically backup to a local drive.
![Node Red Grist backups](../images/newsletters/2024-11/node-red.png)

* enthus1ast shared their very cool [gristImageMap custom widget](https://community.getgrist.com/t/gristimagemap-show-text-on-images-like-on-a-map/2019){:target="\_blank"} early last year with the example use case of sysadmin organization. Kirk_Williams, meanwhile, just shared their [equally satisfying image mapping solution](https://community.getgrist.com/t/gristimagemap-show-text-on-images-like-on-a-map/2019/9){:target="\_blank"}. We simply love to see this! üòç
